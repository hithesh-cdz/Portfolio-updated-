# Portfolio-updated
This is a responsive portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I created this project as a personal revision to strengthen my front-end development skills and reinforce core concepts like responsive design, DOM manipulation, and clean UI structure.

Features:
1.Fully responsive layout across devices
2.Interactive elements using vanilla JavaScript
3.Clean and organized codebase
4.Sections for About Me, Projects, Contact, and more

This project was a great opportunity to practice building a site from scratch without relying on frameworks â€” just pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
